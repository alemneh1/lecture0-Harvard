        <p1 id="pg1">My name is Alemneh, I am from Ethiopia and I am excited to be in this class. 
    I graduated from university of Washington Tacoma in June 2019. I have majored in computer 
    science and mathematics, I like coding and solving problems. I am working as Data engineer 
    at Infosys. Even though I have a strong background in java and python I have a little 
    background at front-end programming so, I am excited to learn. </p1>

        A big reason why I love video games so much, I feel, is because they are an escape from our 
    sometimes boring and monotonous lives. Sometimes it’s nice to put on the shoes of a made-up character 
    and forget about all our troubles. I know that after I’ve had a hard day, I come home and put on a headset 
    and play a good game; Action-adventure games are my favorites because I get sucked into the game’s world 
    and forget about everything around me. Checkout my game selections <a href="game.html">my game selections</a> </pre>
