	<h1>Why Python?</h1>


	<p style="text-indent: 15px",id="pg0">You may or may not know, but the Python programming language </br> 
	is not young by any means. While it’s not quite as old as some of the other </br> 
languages, it’s still been around for longer than most people think. </br> 
It was first released in 1991, and, though it has changed considerably over </br> 
the years, it’s still used for the same things it was back then. </br> 
</br> 
In fact, that’s just one of the reasons why it has become so popular in recent </br> 
years — it’s a production-based language meant for enterprise and first-class </br> 
projects, and it has a rich history. It can be used for just about anything, </br> 
which is why it’s considered so versatile. You can build Raspberry Pi applications, </br> 
scripts for desktop programs and configure servers all via Python, but it’s not limited </br> 
to just those tasks.With Python, there really are no limits.</p>
